\section*{Research Proposal}
How does remote work affect employee productivity?

\section*{Hypotheses}
Null hypothesis: remote work has no effect on employee productivity. \\
Alternative hypothesis: remote work has either a positive or negative effect on employee productivity. 

\section*{Variables}
There are a number of variables that we are considering into measuring employee productivity: 

\subsection*{Major ones}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Self leadership 
  \item Mental health 
  \item Work environment 
  \item Time
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Minor ones}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Training & career development 
  \item Physical health 
  \item Pay
  \item Tooling (communication, work essential tools)
  \item Process & Support (help desk, manager support)
\end{itemize}


\section*{Literature Review}

\subsection*{Health}

As the world comes out of the pandemic, we can learn more about the potential health benefits and negatives of remote work. Aside from the indirect benefits of remote work for mental health and stress from increased control of their time, there are also numerous health benefits as well \cite{doi:10.1177/1529100615593273}. Some of these include a significant reduction in work related stress and exhaustion as a direct result of having that control. There is also evidence to show the lack of travel due to remote work is actually a health benefit as well, as one study has shown that there is a negative correlation between those who commute and physical activity compared to those that do not\cite{HOEHNER2012571}. Another area of consideration has been the potential time saved from commuting and what that time could potentially be used for in terms of improving ones health. Studies have shown that people who do not commute to the office tend to eat less fast food and increase time spent at a gym\cite{allen2008workplace}. 

However there are negative health considerations associated with the prevalence of remote work. The ergonomics of the working space has a major impact on health, which offices have standards and controls for but are not always present for remote work environments. Things to consider include back support, monitor height, arm rests and the location of keyboards and mice which can all contribute to detrimental work from home health and can increase risk of injury\cite{ellison2012ergonomics}. 

\subsection*{Time}

As workers may minimize commuting time by at least 1.5 hours from remote working, they can leave work early and have more time for their personal life \cite{george2022}. In addition, people experience less stress and are more productive as they can use the non-commuting time to sleep more and feel better in the morning \cite{george2022}.

Other studies also suggest that job satisfaction increases when remote employment allows employees more flexibility, autonomy, and time to satisfy their job and their time for family and life \cite{natasha2016}. For instance, people can eat dinner with their families soon after their shift ends instead of spending more than 30 minutes traveling back home and feeling irritated by the traffic congestion. Having high-quality time with family is vital to one’s emotions and mental health. And obviously, employees do more excellent quality work when they are in a pleasant mood and healthy mentality \cite{natasha2016}.

\subsection*{Work environment}

Working in a home environment can provide significant benefits over working in an office. One commonly seen problem with working in an office environment are distractions resulting from needing to constantly interact with co-workers. This is made much worse in offices that are open-plan, where noise and a lack of privacy also become very apparent concerns.\cite{Kim2013}. Working from home helps solve these issues since employees would not need to deal with co-workers in person while also not being exposed to the generally chaotic nature of office environments. Employees are also given more flexibility to interact with their families due to not having to spend a large portion of their day away from home, which can contribute to a better work-life balance that improves both mental and physical health. \cite{Xiao2021}. Additionally, it’s essential for a work environment to have good lighting, ergonomics, air quality, acceptable temperature and humidity, and a low level of noise to ensure that a worker is satisfied and able to work at peak efficiency \cite{Xiao2021}. One of the benefits of working from home is that an employee has full control over these factors since it’s their own home. This gives them the ability to customize aspects of their workspace as they wish, which can give them a great deal of satisfaction and comfort in comparison to being confined to a small cubicle \cite{Xiao2021}.

\subsection*{Training & career development}

Events like COVID-19, followed by mandatory virtual or remote work settings, can have an impact on people's emotional and cognitive reactions, as well as their learning capacities and career development. COVID-19 has undoubtedly altered how Human resources professionals and executives prepare people and organizations for change during uncertain times as well as how people react to the change. Emotional control affects how people process information and develop opinions, which can have significant effects on how they prepare for and make decisions about their careers \cite{Restubog2020}. To reduce the negative effects of emotions, one must actively and deliberately look for ways to manage them by participating in emotionally uplifting activities.

Constant professional growth through virtual mentoring can also enable peak performance, regardless of one's career level. The chance for communication and professional growth are two benefits of virtual mentoring. It is organizations that will ultimately benefit from employees’ career development \cite{Yarberry2021}.  For more mutually beneficial outcomes, human resource development professionals are tasked to shift development initiatives to a virtual/remote environment in response to the new workplace normal.

Remote employees frequently experience social isolation since they do not have many face-to-face meetings and their communications with coworkers are irregular and limited \cite{Park2021}. They feel removed from decision-making processes and less connected to their organizations \cite{Virick2010}.Furthermore, in the context of distant e-work, the "out of sight, out of mind" approach might weaken the importance of personal connections. This might result in a person's career stagnation and professional growth, as well as limited access to social support systems including informal learning and mentorship \cite{Smith2018}.

\section*{Experimental Design}

\subsection*{Methodology}
We have decided to proceed with a quantitative approach for this experiment. We believe it is much easier to model and analyze patterns based on quantitative data rather than qualitative data, providing a much clearer correlation between groups of people and categories of measurements for employee productivity.

\subsection*{Data grouping}

That data collected will be grouped and aggregated with a number of demographic information that we collect from candidates. The following variables are considered:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Age group 
  \item Marital status
  \item Kids
  \item Approximate geographical location
  \item Sex
  \item Ethnicity
  \item Career field
\end{itemize}
These will be used for aggregation and grouping during the analysis, discussion and reporting phase. For example, we can use the data to answer questions such as the following:
\begin{itemize}
  \item How does physical health’s impact on employee productivity vary between different age groups?
  \item How does mental health’s impact on employee productivity vary between different races?
\end{itemize}


\subsection*{Data collection}

A questionnaire contains questions with regards to remote work and employee productivity will be sent out on various websites. The questionnaire will contain questions covering all categories of measurements mentioned in the Variables section above. However, the categories do not weigh the same. We have assigned different weightings for the categories based on research as well as personal experience. \\ \\
All questions will be asked in statements, followed by the following 5 options: 
\begin{itemize}
  \item Strongly disagree
  \item Somewhat disagree
  \item Neutral
  \item Somewhat agree
  \item Strongly agree
\end{itemize}
The candidate answering the question may only select 1 out of the above 5 options for each question. 

\subsection*{Categorical weighting}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Self leadership 10
  \item Mental health 10
  \item Work environment 9
  \item Time 8
  \item Training & career development 4
  \item Physical health 5
  \item Pay 3
  \item Tooling (communication, work essential tools) 4 
  \item Process & Support (help desk, manager support) 3
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Question values}
Values 1 to 5 are assigned on scale between strongly disagree to strongly agree. However, the values are dependent on whether the question is a positive reinforcement to employee productivity. \\
In a positive reinforcement scenario, such as: 
\begin{itemize}
  \item I feel less stressed when I’m working from home. 
  \item I am more productive when I’m working from home. 
\end{itemize}
The option of strongly agree would be assigned a value of 5, while the strongly disagree option would be assigned a value of 1. \\
However, in a negative reinforcement scenario, such as: 
\begin{itemize}
  \item I tend to burn out from working remotely.
  \item I miss face to face contact with colleagues.
\end{itemize}
The vice versa is true. Strongly agree would be assigned a value of 1, while the strongly disagree option would be assigned a value of 5.

\subsection*{Assumptions}
There are several assumptions that we need to make in order to measure employee productivity from this experiment successfully.

\begin{itemize}
  \item Better trained / more qualified for the job = higher productivity
  \item Having better health (mental, physical) = higher productivity
  \item Higher pay = higher productivity
  \item Better tooling = higher productivity
  \item Better support= higher productivity
  \item Negative or disruptive environment = lower productivity
  \item More or complicated processes = lower productivity
\end{itemize}
